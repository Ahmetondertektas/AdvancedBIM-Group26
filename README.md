# Use Case : Sustainability Evaluation​
## Description:
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a building is a comprehensive analysis that assesses the environmental impacts associated with a building's entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to construction, occupancy, and demolition. It evaluates the building's sustainability and environmental performance by considering factors such as energy use, resource consumption, emissions, and waste generation. LCA helps identify areas for improvement in building design, construction, and operation to reduce its overall environmental footprint and enhance its sustainability. This assessment is crucial for making informed decisions about sustainable building practices and reducing the building's long-term impact on the environment.

## Who is this use case for:
In essence, the use case for LCA of a building is diverse and extends to anyone interested in promoting sustainable and environmentally responsible construction and operation practices, from those directly involved in the building process to those who interact with or benefit from the built environment.

###### The use case for conducting a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a building can be relevant to a variety of stakeholders, including:
**Architects and Designers**
**Property Developers**
**Building Owners and Operators**
**Construction Companies**
**Government and Regulatory Bodies**
**Environmental Consultants**
**Green Building Certification Programs**
**Investors and Financial Institutions**
**Environmental Advocates and Nonprofits**
**Educational Institutions**

## Disciplinaries - (non BIM) expertises is being used to solve the use case:
To effectively solve the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of a building, expertise from various non-Building Information Modeling (BIM) disciplines is essential. These disciplines provide valuable insights and data to inform the LCA process. Some key disciplinary expertise includes:
**Environmental scientists**
**Waste Management and Recycling Experts**
**Sustainability Consultants**

## IFC Concepts
Data Validation and extracting material properties and quantities ensure that the data within the IFC model and LCA software are accurate and consistent. Validate the data sources and review the mappings. In this assignment our script will focus on reaching neccessary data to elaborate EPD reports.

## Focused Building Materials

###### Structural Materials:

Concrete: Assess the environmental impact of concrete, which is commonly used for foundations and structural elements. 
Steel: Evaluate the impact of steel used in structural framing and other components.

###### Insulation and Wall Materials:

Insulation Materials: Analyze the materials used for insulation, such as fiberglass, foam, or natural insulators like cellulose.

###### Masonry and Bricks:

Consider the materials for exterior walls.

###### Roofing Materials:

Roofing Membranes: Assess the materials used for roofing, including asphalt, metal, or green roofing options.

###### Doors and Windows:

Window and Door Frames: Consider the materials used for frames and the type of glazing used in windows.
