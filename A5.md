# A5: Project Reflection

## Process of developing the tutorial

Throughout the course, we focused on the collaborative aspects of BIM, exploring how different disciplines within the construction industry can work together can work together seamlessly using IFC models. IFC models could include more complex geometric modelling, parametric design, and the use of advanced tools for creating detailed and accurate models.

BIM is not just about geometry, it’s also about data. 

Our use case covered topics related to managing and integrating various types of data within a BIM environment, including specifications, quantities, and other Life cycle assessment related information.



- Did the process of the course enable you to answer or define questions that you might need later for thesis?
  
  
  
  We have learned how BIM plays a central role in the general digitization of the construction industry. This has inspired us to explore how advanced BIM technologies can help lead the digital transformation within the construction sector. 
  
  Through the course, we have learned how BIM can be used to optimize sustainable building designs. This has motivated us to focus our thesis on the development of sustainable and energy efficient buildings using advanced BIM tools and methods.



- Would you have preferred to have been given less choice in the use cases?
  
  

        Given the amount of use cases, we think it's a good fit that we've had so many         choices to customize our experience based on our unique needs and preferences.         In some situations like that situation, diversity of choices can be essential to meet         a wide range of usage scenarios and needs.



- Was the number of tools for the course ok - should we have more or less? - if so which ones would you leave out?
  
  

        You should have fewer tools for the course, as too many tools can create         confusion and distract from the main goal. And since the course was limited by         time, fewer but more effective tools may be more practical. Or should the course         be a 13-week course + 3-week course, i.e. extend the course to 10 ECTS.



## Your future for Advanced use of OpenBIM

- Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your thesis? 

        Yes, as we want to focus on future trends and innovation in BIM and building         information, OpenBIM may represent a direction where the industry is         moving. However, in order to pursue extracting data from IFC models, our pyton         skills needs to be improved.



- Are you likely to use OpenBIM tools in your professsional life in the next 10 years? 

        Yes, as increased focus on sustainability and life cycle management may lead to         greater requirements for data exchange and interconnection throughout the         building life cycle, which may favor OpenBIM approaches. Although OpenBIM has         the potential to remain relevant, it is important to closely monitor industry         developments and technology trends. The industry may evolve and new         technologies  and approaches may emerge, which may affect the use of         OpenBIM tools in the future.



## Wrap up

Understanding and implementing BIM standards by using Pyton scripting was quite challenging. Due to lack of experience in Pyton and BIM environment, more than halftime of the course duration, we tried to improve our skills in Pyton. To be honest, for 3-4 weeks we have lost the main focus regarding our use case while dealing with scripting. However, just before end of the course we could manage to create our script to extract information in terms of quantities and properties. Overall, getting data from a complex IFC model in desired format (Json, CSV, Excel) was quite useful in terms of LCA calculations. It is clear that we have so much more to learn to improve.
