# A3: OpenBIM Change

## 3A: Analyse use case

###### 1. Goal:

The goal of LCA is to understand and minimize the building's environmental footprint and promote more sustainable construction and maintenance practices. The purpose of this tool / workflow is to enable a comprehensive and effective life cycle analysis of a building. Life cycle analysis is essential for understanding the environmental, economic and social impacts of a building's lifetime, from the production of materials to demolition and recycling. Additionally, this tool aims to enable minimizing energy consumption, as well as CO2 emission.

###### 2. Model Use:

In using Building Information Modeling (BIM) to support the goal of performing an LCA of the building, it is important to identify the necessary BIM applications and usage scenarios. These will help shape the development of the tool and the workflow. Integration of LCA data and processes in BIM to evaluate the environmental impact of the building throughout its lifetime.

###### 4. Description of workflow:

The process begins with the user modifying the BIM model to ensure its suitability for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), taking into account the impact of different materials, such as various insulation materials with potentially significant variations in environmental impact. Subsequently, the BIM file is exported into our tool as an Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) file. The tool then performs simplified calculations of quantities and material properties to provide a straightforward LCA assessment. Additionally, energy framing is calculated by using energy and daylight simulation tools e.g. IDA ICE. Ideally, the code could incorporate Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) for the materials utilized in the construction.

## 3D : Offered potential improvement

###### 7. Business value:

It is possible to forecast environmental impacts of a building by using IFC files and extract material properties and quantities for implemention of EPD reports. Our additional improvement suggestion for the industry is simply importing data from EPD reports and simulation results into IFC file to manipulate and modify building defaults e.g. insulation materials, facade alternatives, glazing type etc. to simulate continiously and optimize energy consumption trends and choose the most efficient construction material alternatives in early stage design of a building.  

The concept of forecasting environmental impacts using IFC files and extracting material properties and quantities for the implementation of Environmental Product Declarations (EPD) reports and energy simulation results by using IDA ICE offers significant business value. Here are some of the bullet points in which this concept can create value for the industry:

- Early-Stage Decision-Making

- Environmental Impact Assessment

- Energy Consumption Trends

- Competitive Advantage

- Compliance and Reporting

- Informed Sustainable Design



###### 8. Societal value:

This concept not only contributes to the environmental sustainability of building projects but also enhances decision-making processes, reduces costs, and positions businesses as leaders in sustainable design and construction. The societal value of this concept lies in its potential to transform the construction industry towards more sustainable and environmentally friendly practices, thereby contributing to global efforts to address climate change, conserve resources, and create healthier, resilient communities. Here's how it contributes to making the world better:

- Ecological Guardianship

- Reduced Carbon Footprint

- Resource Conservation

- Mitigation of Climate Change

- Improved Air and Water Quality

- Public Health and Well-being

- Alignment with Sustainable Development Goals

- Educational Opportunities

- Community Engagement and Satisfaction
